```

Usage
-----

To generate the sources from proto files:

1. Install the protobuf compiler:

```
$ cargo install protobuf
```

2. Install the gRPC compiler:

```
$ cargo install grpcio-compiler
```

3. Generate the sources:

```
$ protoc --rust_out=. --grpc_out=. --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=`which grpc_rust_plugin` example.proto
```

To include this project as a dependency:

```
[dependencies]
grpcio = "0.2"
```
